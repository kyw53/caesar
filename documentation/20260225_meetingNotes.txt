Suggested adding an attribute "@nameid" for persName. May want to change attribute values of cities to use capital letters for output down the road. Created lists for elements to tag. Decided to also start tagging events like battles. Continued to talk about ways to do data visualization, like maybe showing geographical features on map, like Silk Road example. Talked about standardizing dates (where year is mentioned) and using @day="XX" for unknown dates.
